Program Description: A small game with character customization and choose your own story

Plan:
Character Customization:
1.Name
2.Age
3.Randomly generated skills and abilities (strength, agility, intelligence)
4. Personalized companion that can help them during the journey (a pug dog, a black chunky cat, a rat)

Plot:
They're in the hunger games and they have to survive.

1.Game starts with a count down from 10, the user has the choice to run to the middle or to the forest
2.if you go to the center, you have the potential to get a sword and an ally named Rory.
2.if you go to the forest, you have the potential to get an ally named Serena and find water.

There will be 3 endings:
1.Lone Victor where you kill everyone by yourself and lose your mind
2.Sacrifice where you die for your partner
3.Going home where you and your partner go home together
